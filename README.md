# Fast, Beautiful, Reactive Dashboard Apps with Plotly Dash

I presented this talk to the Fayetteville Python group (Fayettepy) at the SupplyPike offices on November 30, 2017.

This talk is essentially a tutorial on Plotly's Dash tech, as well as the importance of telling a story with data. This repo contains two different small dashboards that are good examples of using Dash.

## Running the Code
There are two different dashboards in the src folder. You can run either with just a simple python command, assuming that you have the necessary pip requirements installed.

## Talk Outline
